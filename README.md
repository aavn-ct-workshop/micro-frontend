Bill Gates is one of billionaires in the world. He's very rich. He has a lot of money. For that reason, today we will together help him spent his money on our application.

The application we are going to build with ONE main features is sell / buy the product which will have some requirements:
1. Display Bill remaining money after _buy / sell_ some products.
2. Display a list of products, each product should have _buy / sell_ action.
3. Show and update the receipt on every _buy / sell_ action.

As the workshop organizer, we decide that we separate the application into multiple fragments.  
So that we can work indepently and the team do their fragment freely choose the framework they want.

## Team specific requirements
1. Your team will have main responsibility to integrate together all fragments developed by team 1, team 2, team 3
